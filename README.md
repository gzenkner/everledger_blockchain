An Ethereum style blockchain simulator that allows you to understand the mechanics of a blockchain, interact with it and simulate different actions such as concensus, transaction generation, block mutation and block building an validation. 

Ideas for expanding the functionality include integrating API data from other exchanges to experiment with arbitrage and maximal extractable value.

Statistics as of December 1st 2023

300 blocks are produced every hour or 7200 per day, with very little variation across hours of day
Each block has a mean of 156 transactions and a std of 53 and min of 3 and max of 795

I built a real-time dashboard for real Ethereum ledger data, which I built with Apache Superset and am hosting with Preset, The below snapshots are from the dashboard, which will make the data available until I figure out how to sustainably expose the dashboard to the public.
